# Performance-Prediction-and-Injury-Risk-in-Athletes
Athlete Performance &amp; Injury Risk Prediction **(Python, MATLAB)**: Developed a deep learning model to predict post-injury recovery and estimate performance using training data.
# Athlete Performance & Injury Risk Prediction Using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project predicts **athlete performance and injury risk** using deep learning techniques, analyzing training data to estimate recovery time and future performance post-injury.

## Features
- Predicts likelihood of injury based on historical and training data.
- Estimates post-injury performance using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- Helps in designing safer training schedules and recovery plans.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x, MATLAB
- TensorFlow / Keras (for deep learning)
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Dataset from Kaggle.com

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Athlete-Performance-Prediction.git
